# dotfiles
My macOS/Linux dotfiles managed by [Chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

# Features
* Zsh with oh-my-zsh and antibody.
* Useful aliases/functions for network administrators.
* Automatic installation of macOS apps/brew packages.
* Powerful tmux setup using a modified version of [samoshkin/tmux-config](https://github.com/samoshkin/tmux-config)

# Usage
This repository is not meant to be used blindly. This is 100% what
I'm using right now so you should fork and modify it to suit your needs.

First install Chezmoi:
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
$ brew install twpayne/taps/chezmoi

or on RHEL/CentOS:

$ yum install git -y
$ curl -sfL https://git.io/chezmoi | sh
```

After that, run the following to immediately apply the dotfiles and run the installation script:
```
$ chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/birkhofflee/dotfiles.git
```
GPG shall ask for secret key. You can delete the encrypted files in the repo so
it shouldn't ask anymore. ([dot_shell/encrypted_dot_dnsimple-secrets](dot_shell/encrypted_dot_dnsimple-secrets))

On any machine, pull and apply the latest changes from the repo with:
```
$ chezmoi update
```

# Secrets
In `.shell/.dnsimple-secrets`:
```
DNSIMPLE_ID="12345"
DNSIMPLE_DOMAIN="example.com"
DNSIMPLE_API_KEY="api-key-xxxxxxx"
```
This is used by a function that points specified subdomain to Cloudflare proxy
IP addresses on DNSimple.

# TODO
* Remove server side shell configuration. Shell on servers should be as user-hostile as possible.
